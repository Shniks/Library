### Objectives

1) Create a `Library` class. Add attributes as you wish, but be sure to include a `@collection` instance variable that starts as an empty array.

2) Add a `add_book` method that takes an instance of book and adds it to your collection.

3) Add a `titles` method that iterates over your collection of books and returns only their titles.

4) Add an `authors` method that iterates over your collection of books and returns the authors for each book. Can you make it so that it does not return any duplicate authors?
