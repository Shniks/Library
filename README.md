### Objectives
___________
Create a Library class. Add attributes as you wish, but the be sure to include a @collection instance variable that starts as an empty array.

1) Add a `add_book` method that takes an instance of book and adds it to your collection.

2) Add a `titles` method that iterates over your collection of books and returns only their titles.

3) Add an `authors` method that iterates over your collection of books and returns the authors for each book. Can you make it so that it does not return any duplicate authors?
